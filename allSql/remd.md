The older you get; The more you understand;What you need ;No longer crazy love ; It's someone who won't leave you;like me.

To get; You have to give; To give ;You need to learn to insist ;
If you really find it is hard for you;The you quit ;But once you quit ;Don't complain.

Befor you talk ;Listen .Before you react ;Wait .Before you get angry ;Forgive . Before you quit ; Try .

Hey;How was you day ? Did you make good use of your time ? Have you finished what you need to do? It's never too late to make a 
difference ;Don't sit there and wait.
